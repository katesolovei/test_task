$dbHost = ‘localhost’;
$dbName = ‘test_encomage_db’;
$dbUser = ‘root’;
$dbPass = ‘root’;
$dbTable = ‘users’;
2) Create grid with user information on the main (index) page , where you need to implement
the filtering and searching options by the following columns: ID, First Name, Last Name, Email,
Create Date, Update Date.
To implement table row you should click “ Edit” link, which redirects to editing form.
